                        ## From Political Economy to Economics
                        
                        - The Classics and pre classics were mainly concerned with:
                            - value: price formation
                            - distribution between classes
                            - growth - dynamics

                        - The Marginalists (first order condition) focus:
                            - on the individual decisions of individuals and firms - utilitarian approach - no classes
                            - focus on demand side of consumers goods and supply of factor markets 
                            - allocation of resources - static
                            - mathematical formalization  -> allows economics to be a cumulative knowledge process

                        ### Mathematics in the study of the economy
                        Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth (1838) - Preface

                        > I have said that most authors who have devoted themselves to political economy
                        seem also to have had a wrong idea of the nature of the applications of mathematical analysis
                        to the theory of wealth. They imagined that the use of symbols and formulas could only lead to numerical
                        calculations, and as it was clearly perceived that the subject was not suited to such a numerical
                        determination of values by means of theory alone, the conclusion was drawn that the mathematical apparatus,
                        if not liable to lead to erroneous results, was at least idle and pedantic.
                        But those skilled in **mathematical analysis** know that its object is not simply to calculate numbers,
                        but that it is also employed **to find the relations between magnitudes which cannot be expressed in
                        numbers and between functions whose law is not capable of algebraic expression**.
                        Thus the **theory of probabilities** furnishes a demonstration of very important propositions,
                        although, without the help of experience, it is impossible to give numerical values for contingent events,
                        except in questions of mere curiosity, such as arise from certain games of chance.
                        Thus, also, **theoretical Mechanics** furnishes to practical Mechanics general theorems of most useful
                        application, although in almost all cases recourse to experience is necessary for the numerical results
                        which practice requires.

                        Cournot writes that mathematics allow to identify analytical points more precisely. Although observation is necessary to give a quantification.

                        #### Mathematics as a language

                        Mathematical principles of the Theory of Wealth - Preface

                        > There are authors, like Smith and Say, who, in writing on Political Economy, have preserved all
                        the beauties of a purely literary style ; but there are others, like Ricardo, who, when treating
                        the most abstract questions, or when seeking great accuracy, have not been able to avoid algebra,
                        and have only disguised it under arithmetical calculations of tiresome length. 
                        Any one who understands algebraic notation, reads at a glance in an equation results reached
                        arithmetically only with great labour and pains.
                        **I propose to show in this essay that the solution of the general
                        questions which arise from the theory of wealth, depends essentially
                        not on elementary algebra, but on that branch of analysis which comprises arbitrary functions,
                        which are merely restricted to satisfying certain conditions**. As only very simple conditions 
                        will be considered, the first principles of the differential and integral calculus suffice for
                        understanding this little treatise. Also, although I fear that it may appear too abstruse to 
                        most people who have a liking for these topics, I hardly dare to hope that it will deserve 
                        the attention of professional mathematicians, except as they may discover in it the germ of
                        questions more worthy of their powers.

                        He shifts the focus from algebra to differential calculus.

                        > ... in the writings of economists, the definition of value, and the distinction between absolute and relative
                        value, are rather obscure... 

                        > Let $p_1,p_2,p_3,etc.,$ be the values of certain articles, with reference to a gram of silver; if the 
                        standard of value is changed and a myriagram of wheat is sustituted for the gram of silver, the values 
                        of the same articles will be given by the expressions  $\frac{1}{a}p_1,\frac{1}{a}p_2,\frac{1}{a}p_3,etc.,$ a being the price
                        of the myriagram of wheat, or its value with reference to a gram o silver.

                        > The monetary metals are among the things which under ordinary circumstances and provided that
                        too long a period is not considered, only experience slight absolute variations in their value.
                        If it were not so all transactions would be  disturbed as they are by paper money subject
                        to sudden depreciation.

                        Mathematical principles of the Theory of Wealth - Chapter IV

                        >  To lay the foundations of the theory of exchangeable values, we shall not accompany
                         most speculative writers back to the cradle of the human race 
                         ; we shall undertake to explain neither the origin of property nor that of exchange
                        or division of labour. All this doubdess belongs to the history of mankind, but
                        it has no intfucnce on a theory which could only become applicable at a very advanced state
                        of civilization, at a period when (to use the language of mathematicians) the influence
                        of the initial conditions is entirely gone. 
                        **We shall invoke but a single axiom, or, if you prefer a single hypothesis, i.e. that each
                        one seeks to derive the greatest possible value from his goods or his labour**.

                        > Furthermore, **what is meant by the quantity demanded**?...**The cheaper an article is, the greater ordinarily is the demand for it**. ...We add the word generally as a corrective ;
                         there are, in fact, some objects of whim and luxury which are only desirable on account of their rarity and of the high price which is the consequence thereof.

                        There is a clear shift: history does not matter much. Individuals are "value maximizer" and demand is a function.

                        Mathematical principles of the Theory of Wealth - Chapter IV

                        > **Let us admit therefore that the sales or the annual demand $D$ is, for each article, 
                        a particular function $F(p)$ of the price $p$ of such article. To know the form of this function
                        would be to know what we call the law of demand or of sales.**
                        It depends evidently on the kind of utility of the article, on the nature of the services
                        it can render or the enjoyments it can procure, on the habits and customs of the people,
                        on the average wealth, and on the scale on which wealth is distributed. ... 
                        **Observation must therefore be depended on for furnishing the means of drawing up between proper 
                        limits a table of the corresponding values of $D$ and $p$ ; after which, by the well-known methods
                        of interpolation or by graphic processes, an empiric formula or a curve can be made to represent the function 
                        in question**...

                        Here he proposes to derive the demand from observation of prices and quantities. Of course he incurs in a identification problem.

                        > **We will assume that the function $F(p)$**, which expresses the law of demand or of the market,
                        **is a continuous function**,...If the function $F(p)$ is continuous, it will have the property common
                        to all functions of this nature, and on which so many important applications of mathematical
                        analysis are based : the variations of the demand will be sensibly proportional to the variations
                        in price so iong as these last are small fictions of the original price. Moreover,
                        these variations will be of opposite signs, i.e. an increase in price will correspond with a diminution
                        of the demand.

                        > **Since the function is continuous, the function $pF(p)$ which expresses the total value
                         of the quantity annually sold, must be continuous also**.

                        > Since the function $pF(p)$ at first increases and then decreases as $p$ increases, there is therefore a value of 
                        $p$ which makes this function a **maximum**,
                        and which is given by the equation $$F(p) + pF'(p) = 0$$

                        These are first order conditions.

                        > We know by the theory of maxima and mimima that equation (above) is satisfied as well by the values
                        of $p$ which render $pF(p)$ a minimum as by those which render this product a maximum.
                        The argument used at the beginning of the preceding article shows, indeed, that the function $pF(p)$
                        necessarily has a maximum, **but it might have several and pass through minimum values between**.
                        A root of equation (above) corresponds to a maximum or a minimum according as
                         $$2F'(p)+pF''(p)< or >0$$

                        These are second order conditions

                        > For convenience in discussion, suppose that a man finds himself proprietor of a mineral
                         spring which has just been found to possess salutary properties possessed by no other.
                        He could doubtless fix the price of a liter of this water at 100 francs ;
                        but he would soon see by the scant demand, that this is not the way to make the most of his property.
                        He will therefore successively reduce the price of the liter to the point which will give him
                        the greatest possible profit ; i.e. if $F(p)$ denotes the law of demand, he will end, after various
                        trials, by adopting the value of $p$ which renders the product $pF(p)$ a maximum,
                        or which is determined by the equation
                        $$F\left(p\right)+pF'\left(p\right)=0$$ The product $$pF(p)=\frac{F(p)^2}{-F'(p)}$$
                        will be the annual revenue of the owner of the spring, and this revenue will only depend on the nature of function F.

                        Mathematical principles of the Theory of Wealth - Chapter VII

                        > **Every one has a vague idea of the effects of competition. Theory should have attempted to render this
                          idea more precise; and yet, for lack of regarding the question from the proper point of view 
                            and for want of recourse to symbols of which the use in this connection becomes indispensable**,
                            economic writers have not in the least improved on popular notions in this respect.
                            These notions have remained as ill-defined and ill-applied in their works, as in popular language.
                            To make the abstract idea of monopoly comprehensible, we imagined one spring and one proprietor. 
                            **Let us now imagine two proprietors and two springs of which the qualities are identical**, and which,
                            on account of their similar positions, **supply the same market in competition**.
                            In this case the price is necessarily the same for each proprietor.
                            If $p$ is this price, $D=F(p)$ the total sales,$D_{1}$ the sales from the spring (1) and $D_{2}$
                            the sales from the spring (2), then $D_{1}+D_{2}=D$.
                            If, to begin with, we neglect the cost of production, the respective incomes of the proprietors will be
                            $pD_{1}$ and $pD_{2}$ ; and each of them independently will seek to make this income as large as possible.
                            **We say each independently , and this restriction is very essential**, as will soon appear ;
                            for if they should come to an agreement so as to obtain for each the greatest possible income,
                            the results would be entirely different, and would not differ, so far as consumers are concerned,
                            from those obtained in treating of a monopoly. Instead of adopting $D = F(p)$ as before,
                            in this case it will be convenient to adopt the inverse notation $p=f(D)$
                            and then the profits of proprietors (i) and (2) will be respectively expressed by
                            $$ D_1 \times f(D_1 + D_2) \ and \  D_2 \times f(D_1 + D_2)$$

                        when $D_2$ has been determined by proprietor (2), is to choose for $D_1$ the value which is best for him.
                        This he will be able to accomplish by properly adjusting his price, except as proprietor (2), who, seeing
                        himself forced to accept this price and this value of $D_1$ may adopt a new value for $D_2$ more
                        favourable to his interests than the preceding one.
                        Analytically this is equivalent to saying that $D_1$ will be determined in terms of $D_2$ by the condition
                        $$ \frac{d\left[D_{1}f\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)\right]}{dD_{1}}=0$$
                        and that $D_2$ will be determined in terms of $D_1$ by the analogous condition
                        $$ \frac{d\left[D_{2}f\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)\right]}{dD_{2}}=0$$ 
                        whence it follows that the final values of $D_1$ and $D_2$, and consequently of $D$ and of $p$,
                        will be determined by the system of equations
                        $$ (1) f\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)+D_{1}f'\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)=0$$
                        $$ (2) f\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)+D_{2}f'\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)=0$$

                        >  Let us suppose the curve $m_1n_1$  to be the plot of equation (1),
                         and the curve $m_2n_2$ that of equation (2), the variables $D_1$ and $D_2$ being
                        represented by rectangular coordinates. If proprietor (1) should adopt for $D_1$ a value
                        represented by $ox_1$, proprietor (2) would adopt for $D_2$ the value $oy_1$ , which, for
                        the supposed value of $D_1$ would give him the greatest profit.
                         But then, for the same reason, producer (1) ought to adopt for $D_1$ the value $ox_{11}$ , which gives
                        the maximum profit when $D_2$ has the value $oy_1$. This would bring producer (2) to the value $oy_{11}$
                        for $D_2$ and so forth..
                        The state of equilibrium corresponding to the system of values $ox$ and $oy$ is therefore stable...

                        > The effects of competition have reached their limit, when each of the partial productions $D_k$
                        is **inappreciable**
                        not only with reference to the total production $D = F(p)$but also with reference to the derivative
                        $F'(p)$ so that the partial production $D_k$ could be subtracted from $D$
                        without any appreciable variation resulting in the price of the commodity.... 
                        According to this hypothesis, in the equation
                        $$D_k + \frac{dD}{dp}\left[p-\frac{d\left[\phi_k\left(D_k\right)\right]}{dD}\right]=0$$ the term $D_k$ can be neglected without sensible error,
                        which reduces the equation to $$p-\phi_k(D_k) =0$$
                        In consequence, the system of equations of the preceding chapter will be replaced by
                        $$p-\phi_1(D_1) =0,p-\phi_2(D_2) =0,...,p-\phi_n(D_n) =0$$
                        These $n$ equations together with $$D_1+D_2+...+D_n=F(p),$$
                        will determine all the unknown quantities $p$ and $D_1$,$D_2$,...,$D_n$.
                        If we conceive of all the equations of (i) as solved with reference to $D_1$,$D_2$,...,$D_n$
                        the first member of equation (2) will become a function of $p$, which we can represent by $\Omega(p)$,
                        so that this equation can be written in the very simple form
                        $$\Omega(p)-F(p)=0.$$
                        In the hypothesis under consideration, all the functions $\phi_k'(D_k)$ must be be considered to increase
                        with $D_k$.

                        ### Mathematics to formulate Political Economy

                        Theory of Political Economy - Preface first edition 1871

                        > The contents of the following pages can hardly meet with ready
                        acceptance among those who regard the Science of Political Economay has
                        having already acquired a nearly perfect form. I believe it is generlly
                        supposed that Adam Smith laid the foundations of this science ; that
                        Maltllus, Anderson, and Senior added important doctrines; that Ricardo
                        systematised the whole; and, finally, that Mr. J.S. Mill filled in the
                        details and completely expounded this branch of knowledge...

                        > ...In this work I have attempted **to treat Economy as Calculus of
                        Pleasure and Pain** and have sketched out, almost irrespective of previous
                        opinions, the form which the science, as it seems to me, must ultimately
                        take. I have long thought that as it deals throughout with quantities,
                        it must be a mathematical science in matter if not in language. I
                        endeavoured to arrive at accurate quantitative notions concerning
                        Utility, Value, Labour, Capital, etc., and I have often been surprised
                        to find how clearly some of **the most difficult notion**, especially that
                        most puzzling of notions **Value, admit of mathematical analysis and
                        expression**. **The Theory of Economy thus treated presents a close analogy
                        to the science of Statical Mechanics, and the Laws of Exchange are found
                        to resemble the Laws of Equilibrium of a lever as determined by the
                        principle of virtual velocities.**

                        ### From Political Economy to Economics                       

                        Theory of Political Economy - Preface to the second edition 1879 

                        > In short, I do not write for mathematicians, nor as a mathematician, but
                        as an economist wishing to convince other economists that their science
                        can only be safactorily treated on an explicitly mathematical basis...

                        > ...Among minor alterations, **I may mention the substitution for the name
                        Political Economy of the single convenient term Economics.** This term,
                        besides being more familiar and closely related to the old term is
                        perfectly analogous in form to Mathematics, Ethics, Esthetics, and the
                        names of various other branches of knowledge, and it has moreover the
                        authority of usage from the time of Aristotle...but **it appears to have
                        been adopted also by Mr. Alfred Marshall** at Cambridge.

                        > ...The earlier treatise of Cournot, his admirable Recherche sur le
                        principes Mathematiques de la Theorie des Richesses (Paris 1838),
                        resembles Dupuit's memoirs in being, until the last few years, quite
                        unkwonwn to English economists...**Cournot did not frame any ultimate
                        theory of the ground and nature of utility and value**, but, taking the
                        palpable facts known concerning the relations of price, production and
                        consumption of commodities, he investigated these relations analytically
                        and diagraphically with a power and felicity which leaves little to be
                        desired. ..It should be added that his investigation has little relation
                        to the contents of this work, because Cournot does not recede to any
                        theory of utility, but commences with the phenomenal laws of supply and
                        demand.

                        > From this statement it is quite apparent that Gossen has completely
                        anticipated me as regards the general principles and method of the
                        theory of Economics.

                        But the revolution already occurred.

                        ### Theory of value based on utility

                        Theory of Political Economy - Introduction

                        > Repeated reflection and inquiry have led me to the somewhat novel
                        opinion, that **value depends entirely upon utility**. Prevailing opinions
                        make labour rather than utility the origin of value; and there are even
                        those who distinctly assert that labour is the cause of value. I show,
                        on the contrary, that we have only to trace out carefully the natural
                        laws of the variation of utility, as depending upon the quantity of
                        commodity in our possession, in order to arrive at a satisfactory theory
                        of exchange, of which the ordinary laws of supply and demand are a
                        necessary consequence. This theory is in harmony with facts; and,
                        whenever there is any apparent reason for the belief that labour is the
                        cause of value, we obtain an explanation of the reason. **Labour is found
                        often to determine value, but only in an indirect manner, by varying the
                        degree of utility of the commodity through an increase or limitation of
                        the supply** ....

                        > It is clear that Economics, if it is to be a science at all, must be a
                        mathematical science...My theory of Economics, however, is purely
                        mathematical in character.

                        ### Utility

                        Theory of Political Economy - The theory of Utility - Chapter III 

                        > **Pleasure and pain are undoubtedly the ultimate objects of the Calculus
                        of Economics. To satisfy our wants to the utmost with the least
                        effort, to procure the greatest amount of what is desirable at the
                        expense of the least that is undesirable in other words, to maximise
                        pleasure, is the problem of Economics.**

                        > **By a commodity we shall understand any object, substance, action, or
                        service, which can afford pleasure or ward off pain...and employ the
                        term utility to denote the abstract quality whereby an object serves our
                        purposes, and becomes entitled to rank as a commodity.**

                        > My principal work now lies in tracing out the **exact nature and
                        conditions of utility**. It seems strange indeed that economists have not
                        bestowed more minute attention on a subject which doubtless furnishes
                        the true key to the problem of Economics.

                        Theory of Political Economy - The theory of Utility - Chapter III

                        > **Utility must
                        be considered as measured by, or even as actually identical with, the
                        addition made to a person's happiness.** It is a convenient name for the
                        aggregate of the favorable balance of feeling produced, the sum of the
                        pleasure created and the pain prevented. **We must now carefully
                        discriminate between the total utility arising from any commodity and
                        the utility attaching to any particular portion of it.** Thus the total
                        utility of the food we eat consists in maintaining life, and may be
                        considered as infinitely great; but if we were to subtract a tenth part
                        from what we eat daily, our loss would be but slight. We should
                        certainly not lose a tenth part of the whole utility of food to us. It
                        might be doubtful whether we should suffer any harm at all.

                        > Let us imagine the whole quantity of food which a person consumes on an
                        average during twenty- four hours to be divided into ten equal parts. If
                        his food be reduced by the last part, he will suffer but little; if a
                        second tenth part be deficient, he will feel the want distinctly; the
                        subtraction of the third tenth part will be decidedly injurious; with
                        every subsequent subtraction of a tenth part his sufferings will be more
                        and more serious, until at length he will be upon the verge of
                        starvation. Now, if we call each of the tenth parts an increment, the
                        meaning of these facts is, that each increment of food is less
                        necessary, or possesses less utility, than the previous one. To explain
                        this variation of utility we may make use of space representations,
                        which I have found convenient in illustrating the laws of economics in
                        my college lectures during fifteen years past.

                        > Let the line $ox$ be used as a measure of the quantity of food, and let it
                        be divided into ten equal parts to correspond to the ten portions of
                        food mentioned above. Upon these equal lines are constructed rectangles
                        and the area of each rectangle may be assumed to represent the utility
                        of the increment of food corresponding to its base. Thus the utility of
                        the last increment is small, being proportional to the small rectangle
                        on X. As we approach towards o, each increment bears a larger rectangle,
                        that standing upon III being the largest complete rectangle. **The utility
                        of the next increment, II, is undefined, as also that of I, since these
                        portions of food would be indispensable to life, and their utility,
                        therefore, infinitely great**.

                        > But the division of the food into ten equal parts is an arbitrary
                        supposition. If we had taken twenty or a hundred or more equal parts,
                        the same general principle would hold true, namely, that each small
                        portion would be less useful and necessary than the last. The law may be
                        considered to hold true theoretically, however small the increments are
                        made; and in this way we shall at last reach a figure which is
                        undistinguishable from a continuous curve. **The notion of infinitely
                        small quantities of food may seem absurd as regards the consumption of
                        one individual; but when we consider the consumption of a nation as a
                        whole, the consumption may well be conceived to increase or diminish by
                        quantities which are, practically speaking, infinitely small compared
                        with the whole consumption.** The laws which we are about to trace out are
                        to be conceived as theoretically true of the individual; they can only
                        be practically verified as regards the aggregate transactions,
                        productions, and consumptions of a large body of people. But the laws of
                        the aggregate depend of course upon the laws applying to individual
                        cases....

                        Today we know that we cannot use what holds for an individual to hold at the aggregate level
                        except in special cases and in the case of the representative agent.

                        > Let $x$ signify, as is usual in mathematical books, the quantity which
                        varies independently, in this case the quantity of commodity. Let $u$
                        denote the **whole utility** proceeding from the consumption of $x$. Then
                        $u$ will be, as mathematicians say, a function of $x$; that is, it will
                        vary in some continuous and regular, but probably unknown, manner, when
                        x is made to vary...Our great object at present, however, is to express the **degree of utility**.

                        > We find these considerations fully illustrated by Fig. IV., in which oa
                        represents $x$, and $ab$ is the degree of utility at the point $a$. Now,
                        if we increase $x$ by the small quantity $aa'$, or $\Delta  x$, the utility is increased
                         by the small rectangle $abb'a'$, or $\Delta    u$; and, since a rectangle is the product of its sides,
                          we find that the length of the line ab, the degree of utility, is represented by the fraction
                           $\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x}$.

                        > As already explained, however, the utility of a commodity may be
                        considered to vary with perfect continuity, so that we commit a small
                        error in assuming it to be uniform over the whole increment $\Delta x$. To
                        avoid this we must imagine $\Delta x$ to be reduced to an infinitely small
                        size, Du decreasing with it. The smaller the quantities are the more
                        nearly we shall have a correct expression for $ab$, the degree of
                        utility at the point $a.$ **Thus the limit of this fraction
                        $\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x}$ or, as it is commonly expressed
                        $\frac{du}{dx}$ , is the degree of utility corresponding to the quantity
                        of commodity $x$**. The degree of utility is, in mathematical language,
                        the differential coefficient of $u$ considered as a function of $x$, and
                        will itself be another function of $x$.

                        > **We shall seldom need to consider the degree of utility except as regards
                        the last increment which has been consumed**, or, which comes to the same
                        thing, the next increment which is about to be consumed. I shall
                        therefore commonly use the expression **final degree of utility, as
                        meaning the degree of utility of the last addition**, or the next possible
                        addition of a very small, or infinitely small, quantity to the existing
                        stock. In ordinary circumstances, too, the final degree of utility will
                        not be great compared with what it might be.

                        > **The final degree of utility is that function upon which the theory of
                        economics will be found to turn**. Economists, generally speaking, have
                        failed to discriminate between this function and the total utility, and
                        from this confusion has arisen much perplexity. Many commodities which
                        are most useful to us are esteemed and desired but little. We cannot
                        live without water, and yet in ordinary circumstances we set no value on
                        it. Why is this? Simply because we usually have so much of it that its
                        final degree of utility is reduced nearly to zero. We enjoy every day
                        the almost infinite utility of water, but then we do not need to consume
                        more than we have. Let the supply run short by drought, and we begin to
                        feel the higher degrees of utility, of which we think but little at
                        other times.

                        ### Exchange - Value

                        Theory of Political Economy - Theory of Exchange - chapter IV 


                        > I must, in the first place, point out the thoroughly ambiguous and
                        unscientific character of the term value. Adam Smith noticed the extreme
                        difference of meaning between value in use and value in exchange; and it
                        is usual for writers on Economics to caution their readers against the
                        confusion of thought to which they are liable.

                      
                        > **The keystone of the whole Theory of Exchange, and of the principal
                        problems of Economics, lies in this proposition---The ratio of exchange
                        of any two commodities will be the reciprocal of the ratio of the final
                        degrees of utility of the quantities of commodity available for
                        consumption after the exchange is completed.** When the reader has
                        reflected a little upon the meaning of this proposition, he will see, I
                        think, that it is necessarily true, if the principles of human nature
                        have been correctly represented in previous pages.

                        Theory of Political Economy - Theory of Exchange - chapter IV


                        > Imagine that there is one trading body possessing only corn, and another
                        possessing only beef. It is certain that, under these circumstances, a
                        portion of the corn may be given in exchange for a portion of the beef
                        with a considerable increase of utility. How are we to determine at what
                        point the exchange will cease to be beneficial? This question must
                        involve both the ratio of exchange and the degrees of utility. Suppose,
                        for a moment, that the ratio of exchange is approximately that of ten
                        pounds of corn for one pound of beef: then if, to the trading body which
                        possesses corn, ten pounds of corn are less useful than one of beef,
                        that body will desire to carry the exchange further. Should the other
                        body possessing beef find one pound less useful than ten pounds of corn,
                        this body will also be desirous to continue the exchange. Exchange will
                        thus go on until each party has obtained all the benefit that is
                        possible, and loss of utility would result if more were exchanged. Both
                        parties, then, rest in satisfaction and equilibrium, and the degrees of
                        utility have come to their level, as it were. **This point of equilibrium
                        will be known by the criterion, that an infinitely small amount of
                        commodity exchanged in addition, at the same rate, will bring neither
                        gain nor loss of utility. In other words, if increments of commodities
                        be exchanged at the established ratio, their utilities will be equal for
                        both parties.** Thus, if ten pounds of corn were of exactly the same
                        utility as one pound of beef, there would be neither harm nor good in
                        further exchange at this ratio.... 
                        
                        > To represent this process of
                        reasoning in symbols, let $\Delta x$ denote a small increment of corn, and $\Delta y$ a
                        small increment of beef exchanged for it. Now our Law of Indifference
                        comes into play. As both the corn and the beef are homogeneous
                        commodities, no parts can be exchanged at a different ratio from other
                        parts in the same market: hence, if $x$ be the whole quantity of corn
                        given for $y$ the whole quantity of beef received, $y$ must have the same
                        ratio to $x$ as $y$ to $x$; we have then,
                        $$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y}{x}  \\ or \\  \Delta y=\frac{y}{x}\Delta x.$$

                        Theory of Political Economy - Theory of Exchange - chapter IV


                        > In a state of equilibrium, the utilities of these increments must be
                        equal in the case of each party, in order that neither more nor less
                        exchange would be desirable. Now the increment of beef,$\Delta y$, is
                        $y/x$ times as great as the increment of corn, $\Delta x$, so that, in
                        order that their utilities shall be equal, the degree of utility of beef
                        must be $x/y$ times as great as the degree of utility of corn.

                        > Thus we arrive at the principle that the degrees of utility of commodities
                         exchanged will be in the inverse proportion of the magnitudes of the
                        increments exchanged. Let us now suppose that the first body, $A$,
                        originally possessed the quantity $a$ of corn, and that the second body, $B$,
                        possessed the quantity $b$ of beef. As the exchange consists in giving $x$ 
                        of corn for $y$ of beef, the state of things after exchange will be as follows:
                                         $A$ holds $a-x$ of corn, and $y$ of beef,
                        $B$ holds $x$ of corn, and $b-y$ of beef.
                        Let $\varphi_{1}(a-x)$ denote the final degree of utility of corn to A,
                        and $\varphi_{2}(x)$ the corresponding function for $x$.
                        Also let $\psi_{1}(y)$ denote A’s final degree of utility for beef, and $\psi_{2}(b-y)$ B’s similar function.
                         Then, as explained previously will not be satisfied unless the following equation holds true: $$\phi_{1}\left(a-x\right)dx	=\psi_{1}(y)dy \\\\
                        or\\ 	\frac{\phi_{1}\left(a-x\right)}{\psi_{1}(y)}=\frac{dy}{dx}$$

                        Theory of Political Economy - Theory of Exchange - chapter IV

                        > Hence, substituting for the second member by the equation given
                        previously, we have
                        $$\frac{\phi_{1}(a-x)}{\psi_{1}(y)}=\frac{y}{x}$$ What holds
                        true of A will also hold true of B, mutatis mutandis. He must also
                        derive exactly equal utility from the final increments, otherwise it
                        will be for his interest to exchange either more or less, and he will
                        disturb the conditions of exchange. Accordingly [substituting as
                        before] the following final equation must hold true... :
                        $$\frac{\phi_{2}\left(x\right)}{\psi_{2}\left(b-y\right)}=\frac{y}{x}$$
                        We arrive, then at the conclusion that whenever two commodities are
                        exchanged for each other, and more or less can be given or received in
                        infinitely small quantities, the quantities exchanged satisfy two
                        equations, which may be stated thus in a concise form
                        $$\frac{\phi_{1}\left(a-x\right)}{\psi_{1}y}=\frac{y}{x}=\frac{\phi_{2}\left(x\right)}{\psi_{2}\left(b-y\right)}$$

                                              
                        > But though labour is never the cause of value, it is in a large
                        proportion of cases the determining circumstance, and in the following
                        way: Value depends solely on the final degree of utility. How can we
                        vary this degree of utility? By having more or less of the commodity to
                        consume. And how shall we get more or less of it? By spending more or
                        less labour in obtaining a supply. I will re-state it in a tabular form,
                        as follows:
                        **Cost of production determines supply.
                        Supply determines final degree of utility.
                        Final degree of utility determines value.
                        But it is easy to go too far in considering labour as the regulator of
                        value**;

                        ### Labour supply

                        Theory of Political Economy - The theory of Labour - chapter V


                        > Let us endeavour to form a clear notion of what we mean by **amount of
                        labour**. It is plain that **duration** will be one element of it; for a
                        person labouring uniformly during two months must be allowed to labour
                        twice as much as during one month. But labour may vary also in
                        **intensity**. In the same time a man may walk a greater or less distance;
                        may saw a greater or less amount of timber; may pump a greater or less
                        quantity of water; in short, may exert more or less muscular and nervous
                        force. Hence amount of labour will be a quantity of two dimensions, the
                        product of intensity and time when the intensity is uniform, or the sum
                        represented by the area of a curve when the intensity is variable.

                        > But intensity of labour may have more than one meaning; it may mean the
                        quantity of work done, or the painfulness of the effort of doing it.
                        These two things must be carefully distinguished, and both are of great
                        importance for the theory. The one is the reward, the other the penalty,
                        of labour. Or rather, as the produce is only of interest to us so far as
                        it possesses utility, we may say that there are three quantities
                        involved in the theory of labour the amount of painful exertion, the
                        amount of produce, and the amount of utility gained. **The variation of
                        utility, as depending on the quantity of commodity possessed, has
                        already been considered; the variation of the amount of produce will be
                        treated in the next chapter; we will here give attention to the
                        variation of the painfulness of labour.**

                        > We may imagine the painfulness of labour in proportion to produce to be
                        represented by some such curve as $abcd$ in Fig VIII. In this diagram the
                        height of points above the line ox denotes pleasure, and depth below it
                        pain. At the moment of commencing labour it is usually more irksome than
                        when the mind and body are well bent to the work. Thus, at first, the
                        pain is measured by $oa$. At $b$ there is neither pain nor pleasure.
                        Between $b$ and $c$ an excess of pleasure is represented as due to the
                        exertion itself. But after $c$ the energy begins to be rapidly
                        exhausted, and the resulting pain is shown by the downward tendency of
                        the line $cd$.


                        > We may at the same time represent the degree of utility of the produce by Somecurve as $pq$, the amount 
                        of produce being measured along the line $ox$. Agreeably to the theory of utility, already given
                        the curve shows that, the larger the wages earned, the less is the pleasure derived from a further increment.
                        There will, of necessity be some point $m$ such that $qm=dm$, that is to say, such that that the pleasure gained is exactly equal to the labour endured.

                        > It may tend to give the reader confidence in the preceding theories when
                        he finds that they lead directly to the well-known law, as stated in the
                        ordinary language of economists, that value is proportional to the cost
                        of production. As I prefer to state the same law, it is to the effect
                        that the ratio of exchange of commodities will conform in the long run
                        to the ratio of productiveness, which is the reciprocal of the ratio of
                        the costs of production.

                        > To simplify our expressions, let us substitute for the rate of
                        production $\frac{dx}{dl}$ the symbol $\bar{\omega}$. Then
                        `$\bar{\omega}_{1}$`
                        , `$\bar{\omega}_{2}$` express the relative quantities of
                        two different commodities produced by an increment of labour...so that
                        we may at once deduce the all-important equation
                        `$\frac{\bar{\omega}_{2}}{\bar{\omega}_{1}}=\frac{y_{1}}{x_{1}}$`.

                        

                        > **Value is of course very frequently estimated by price**, that is, by the
                        quantity of legal money for which the commodity may be exchanged. Price
                        is indeed ambiguous in the same way as value; it means either the price
                        of the whole quantity, or the price per unit of the quantity. Let
                        $p_{1}$ be the price per unit of $X$, and $p_{2}$ the similar price of
                        $Y$. Then it is apparent that $y\times p_{2}$ will be the whole price of
                        $y$, and $x\times p_{1}$ will be the whole price of $x$. These two must
                        be equal to each other, so that we get
                        $\frac{y}{x}=\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$.


                        > Turning now to the production of commodity, it is sufficiently obvious
                        that the cost of production, so far as this expression can be accurately
                        interpreted, varies as the reciprocal of the degree of productiveness.
                        The rate of wages remaining constant, the cost per unit of commodity
                        must of course be lower as the quantity produced in return for a certain
                        amount of wages is greater. Thus we may lay down the equation:

                        Jevons almost complete the reasoning the arrive to general equilibrium but not yet.

                        Elements of Pure Economics 1874 first edition 1926 definitive edition (3rd in 1896) - preface  

                        > It contains a mathematical solution of the problem of the determination
                        of current prices and also formulation of the law of offer and demand in
                        the case of the exchange on any number of commodities for one
                        another...

                        > ...a month ago, my attention was drawn to a work on the same subject,
                        entitled: The Theory of Political Economy, Macmillan & Co., 1871, by W.
                        Stanley Jevons, Professor of Political Economy at Manchester. Mr. Jevons
                        applies mathematical analysis to pure economics, especially to the
                        theory of exchange, very much as I do; and, what is really remarkable,
                        he founds the whole application of mathematics to economics on a
                        fundamental formula which he calls the equation of exchange and which is
                        rigorously identical with the formula which serves as my point of
                        departure and which I call the condition of maximum satisfaction.

                        > Pure economics is, in essence, the theory of the determination of prices
                        under a hypothetical regime of perfectly free competition. The sum total
                        of all things, material or immaterial, on which a price can be set
                        because they are scarce (i.e. both useful and limited in quantity)
                        constitutes social wealth. Hence pure economics is also the theory of
                        social wealth.

                        > ...then it becomes possible to arrive successively at: (1) a
                        determination of the prices of consumers' goods and services by means of
                        the theory of exchange (2) a determination of the prices of raw
                        materials and productive services by means of the theory of production,
                        (3) a determination of the price of fixed capital goods by means of the
                        theory of capitalization, and (4) a determination of the prices of
                        circulating capital goods by means of the theory of circulation. I shall
                        now proceed to show how this is done.

                        #### Demand as a maximization of Utility

                        Elements of Pure Economics - Utility curves or want curves - Lesson 8 

                        > ...If, in fact, prices result mathematically from demand curves, the
                        causes and primary conditions that generate and affect demand curves
                        will also generate and affect prices.

                        > ...I shall, therefore, assume the existence of a standard measure of
                        intensity of wants or intensive utility, which is applicable not only to
                        similar units of the same kind of wealth but also to different units of
                        various kinds of wealth.

                        > ...Let us define prices in general as ratios between values in exchange
                        or as relative values in exchange. In general, also, let us designate
                        the price of (B) in terms of $(A)$ by $p_{b}$ and the price of $(A)$ in
                        terms of $(B)$ by $p_{a}$...

                        > If we let the term effective utility designate the sum total of wants
                        satisfied by any given quantity consumed of a commodity, these wants
                        being measured in terms of both their extensive and intensive missions,
                        then the curve $\beta_{r,1}\beta_{q,1}$ becomes our indivlduars curve of
                        effective utility, considered \[in respect of the enclosed area\] as a
                        function of the quantity of (B) which he consumes. For example, in case
                        he consumes the quantity $q_b$ of $(B)$ represented by the length $Oq_{b}$ the
                        effective utility is represented by the area $Oq_{b}\rho\beta_{r,1}$. If
                        now, we **let the term rarete designate the intensity of the last want
                        satisfied by any given quantity consumed of a commodity**, then the curve
                        becomes our individual's rarete curve, considered as a function of the
                        quantity of $(B)$ which he consumes. Thus, in case he consumes a
                        quantity $q_{b}$ of $(B)$, represented by the length $Oq_{b}$, the
                        rarete is $\rho_{b}$, represented by the length $q_{b}\rho=O\rho_{b}$,.
                        Similarly, the curve $\alpha_{r,1}\alpha_{q,1}$ is, at one and the same
                        time, a curve of effective utility and a rarete curve, both being
                        functions of the quantity of $(A)$ consumed. Hence I call one of the
                        co-ordinate axes the rarete axis and the other the quantity axis. I
                        repeat, that rarete increases as the quantity possessed decreases, and
                        vice versa.

                        > Analytically, if we are given effective utilities as functions of the
                        quantities consumed according to the equations
                        $u=\Phi_{a,1}\left(q\right)$ and $u=\Phi_{b,1}\left(q\right)$ the
                        raretes are designated by the derivatives $\Phi_{a,1}'\left(q\right)$
                        and $\Phi_{a,1}'\left(q\right)$. If, on the other hand, we are given the
                        raretes as functions of the quantities consumed, according to the
                        equations $r=\phi_{a,1}\left(q\right)$ and
                        $r=\phi_{b,1}\left(q\right)$then the effective utilities are designated
                        by the definite integrals from $0$ to $q$:
                        $\int_{0}^{q}\phi_{a,1}\left(q\right)dq$ and
                        $\int_{0}^{q}\phi_{b,1}\left(q\right)dq$. We then have for $u$ and $r$
                        the mutually related expressions
                        $$u=\Phi\left(q\right)=\int_{0}^{q}\phi\left(q\right)dq,$$ and
                        $$r=\Phi'\left(q\right)=\phi\left(q\right).$$

                        > If we suppose that **his object in trading is to gratify the greatest
                        possible sum total of wants**, then, surely, $d_{a}$ is determine for a
                        given $p_{a}$ by the condition that the sum of the two areas,
                        $Oy\beta\beta_{r,1}$ and $Od_{a}\alpha\alpha_{r,1}$be maximized. Now the
                        condition of such a maximum is that the ratio of the intensities
                        $r_{a,1}$ and $r_{b,1}$ of the last wants satisfied by the quantities
                        $d_{a}$ and $y$, i.e. the ratio of their respective raretes upon
                        completion of this exchange, be equal to the price $p_{a}$.

                        we replace $r_{a,1}$ and $r_{b,1}$ by their equivalents, then
                        `$$\begin{aligned}

                        Here $q_{b}$ is the endowment of good b and $o_{b}$ is the quantity exchanged and we use $o_{b} = d_{a}p_{a}$.

                        the equation to be solved for the first of the two variables, this
                        relation reduces to $$d_{a}=f_{a,1}\left(p_{a}\right).$$

                        Elements of Pure Economics - General solution of two-commodity problem - Lesson 9 

                        > To sum up, if, for simplicity, we designate by $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$ the
                        positive or negative quantities of commodities (A) and (B) which party

                        $q_{a,1}$ and $q_{b,1}$, of these commodities, then his exchange
                        schedule will result from the following two equations, one of exchange
                        and the other of maximum satisfaction:...

                        > These equations, when solved for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, and appropriately
                        adapted to satisfy the above-mentioned restrictions, take the form

                        Similarly, we could deduce the following expressions for the trading
                        schedules of individuals (2),(3).  ...

                        > The equality between the \[aggregate\] effective demand and offer of
                        each of the two commodities (A) and (B) could be expressed by either of
                        the following equations
                        $$X=f_{a,1}\left(p_{a}\right)+f_{a,1}\left(p_{a}\right)+f_{a,1}\left(p_{a}\right)+...=F_{a}\left(p_{a}\right)=0,$$
                        or
                        $$Y=f_{b,1}\left(p_{b}\right)+f_{b,1}\left(p_{b}\right)+f_{b,1}\left(p_{b}\right)+...=F_{b}\left(p_{b}\right)=0.$$
                        For example, we could derive $p_{a}$ from the first of these equations,
                        and then $p_{b}$ from the equation $$p_{a}p_{b}=1,$$ and thus obtain a
                        value of $p_{b}$ which would necessarily satisfy the second of the above
                        equations...

                        Elements of Pure Economics - Capital and income; the three services - Lesson 17 

                        > Thus far, however, we have left out of consideration the fact that
                        commodities are products which result from the combination of productive
                        factors such as land, men and capital goods....Our solution of the
                        problem of exchange led to a scientific formulation of the law of offer
                        and demand. ***Our solution of the problem of production brings us to a
                        scientific formulation of the law of the cost of production or of cost
                        price***. Though, in the end, I shall do no more than rediscover two
                        well-known fundamental laws of economics, I shall do so with this
                        difference, that instead of presenting them as conflicting and mutually
                        contradictory in the determination of prices, I shall assign to each its
                        proper role...

                        > In other words, **we still have to inquire whether the prices of productive
                        services determine the prices of products, as it is often claimed, or
                        whether the prices of products, having already been determined, as we
                        have seen, by the operation of the law of offer and demand, determine,
                        in their turn, the prices of the productive services by the operation of
                        the law of the cost of production or of cost price**.

                        > Let $p_{t},p_{p},p_{k},...,p_{b},p_{c},p_{d},...$be the current prices
                        of the services and products in terms of $(A)$. Let
                        $o_{t},o_{p},o_{k},...$. be the quantities of the services which our
                        individual effectively offers at these prices. These quantities can be
                        either positive when they represent quantities offered or negative when
                        they represent quantities demanded. And finally let
                        $d_{a},d_{b},d_{c},d_{d},...$ be the quantities of the products which
                        our individual effectively demands at these same equilibrium prices....

                        > We may, then, start with the following equation relating the above
                        quantities and prices:
                        `$$o_{t}p_{t}+o_{p}p_{p}+o_{k}p_{k}+...=d_{a}+d_{b}p_{b}+d_{c}p_{c}+d_{d}p_{d}+...$$`
                        From the condition of maximum satisfaction, which obviously determines
                        the positive or negative offer of services and the demand for products,
                        we have, in addition, the following equations relating the same
                        quantities and prices `$$\begin{aligned}
                        \phi_{t}\left(q_{t}-o_{t}\right) & =p_{t}\phi_{a}\left(d_{a}\right),\\
                        \phi_{p}\left(q_{p}-o_{p}\right) & =p_{p}\phi_{a}\left(d_{a}\right),\\
                        \phi_{k}\left(q_{k}-o_{k}\right) & =p_{k}\phi_{a}\left(d_{a}\right),\\

                        constituting in all $n+m-1$ equations which together with the preceding
                        equation give us a system of $n+m$ equations.

                        $2m+2n-1$ equations to determine $2m+2n-1$ unknowns which are: (1) the
                        $n$ total quantitites of services offered, (2) the $n$proces of these
                        services, (3) the $m$ total quantities of the products demanded and (4)
                        the $m-1$ prices of these products in temrs of the $m$th. It still
                        remains to be shown that, for equilibrium in production as for
                        equilibrium in exchange, this problem to which we have given a
                        theoretical solution is the same problem which is solved in practice in
                        the market by the mechanism of free competition.

                        Elements of Pure Economics - Productions Equations - Lesson 20


                        > In exchange, [the total existing quantities of] commodities do not
                        under go any change. When a price is cried,and the effective demand and offer
                        corresponding to this price are not equal, another price is cried for
                        which there is another corresponding effective demand and offer. In
                        production, productive services are transformed into products. After
                        certain prices for services have been cried and certain quantities of
                        products have been manufactured, if these prices and quantities are not
                        the equilibrium prices and quantities, it will be necessary not only to
                        cry new prices but also to manufacture revised quantities of products.

                        (tatonnement) [towards equilibrium] in production.

                        > There is still another complication. Once the equilibrium has been
                        established in principle eexchange can take place immediately.
                        Production, however, requires a certain lapse of time. We shall resolve
                        the second difficulty purely and simply by ignoring the time element at
                        this point.

                        Elements of Pure Economics - Variation of prices of products and services - Lesson 22 

                        
                        > ...We can now see how certain objections to our method fall to the
                        ground of their own weight... "Precisely" we are told, **"absolutely free
                        competition is only an hypothesis. In reality, the working of free
                        competition is obstructed by an infinite number of disturbing factors.**
                        **It is, therefore, pointless, apart from the gratification of idle
                        curiosity. to study free competition by itself, uninfluenced by
                        perturbations which defy mathematical computation."** The futility of this
                        objection is obvious. Even supposing that the future development of our
                        science will never allow these disturbing factors to be incorporated
                        into our equations of exchange certainly a useless prognostic, if not a
                        rash one nevertheless, **the equations we have developed do show freedom
                        of production to be the superior general rule. dom procures, within
                        certain limits, the maximum of utility; and, since the factors which
                        interfere with freedom are obstacles to the attainment of this maximum,
                        they should, without exception, be eliminated as completely as possible.**
                        Of course, economists have been saying all along that they advocate
                        laisser-faire, laisser-passer. **Unfortunately, it must be said that up to
                        the present economists have been less concerned with establishing proofs
                        for their arguments in favour of iaisser-faire, laisser-passer** than they
                        have been with using them as weapons against the socialists, new and
                        old, who for their part are equally negligent in establishng proofs for
                        their arguments in favour of State intervention.

                        


                        > For example, in the theory we are developing in this book, the first
                        foundation on which our proof of the principle of free competition rests
                        is the **individual consumer's appreciation of the utility of final
                        products and services**. Our proof implies a **fundamental distinction
                        between individual wants, i.e. private utility which the individual is
                        capable of estimating, and social wants or public utility which is
                        estimated in an entirely different way**. Therefore, the principle of free
                        competition, which is applicable to the production of things for private
                        demand, is not applicable to the production of things where public
                        interest is involved. Are there not economists, however, who have fallen
                        into the error of advocating that public services be brought within the
                        fold of free competition by turning these services over to private
                        industry?

                        selling price are equal, the prices of the services are proportional to
                        their marginal productivities, i.e., to the partial derivatives of the

                        first sight to be **antagonistic to that of earlier writers**; **but** when it

                        have been worn away, **it has been found to involve no real breach of

                        > Under the guidance of Cournot, and in a less degree of von Thunen, **I was
                        led to attach great importance** to the fact that our observations of

                        aggregate quantities, as to increments of quantities, and that in
                        particular **the demand for a thing is a continuous function, of which the
                        "marginal" increment is, in stable equilibrium, balanced against the
                        corresponding increment of its cost of production**. It is not easy to get
                        a clear full view of continuity in this aspect without the aid either of
                        mathematical symbols or of diagrams....

                        > **The chief use of pure mathematics in economic questions seems to be in
                        helping a person to write down quickly, shortly and exactly, some of his
                        thoughts for his own use** : and to make sure that he has enough, and only
                        enough, premisses for his conclusions (i.e. that his equations are
                        neither more nor less in number than his unknowns).


                        > **The forces to be dealt with are however so numerous, that it is best to
                        take a few at a time; and to work out a number of partial solutions as
                        auxiliaries to our main study**. Thus we begin by isolating the primary
                        relations of supply, demand and price in regard to a particular
                        commodity. We reduce to inaction all other forces by the phrase **"other
                        things being equal"**: we do not suppose that they are inert, but for the
                        time we ignore their activity.

                        > It is the business of economics, as of almost every other science, to
                        **collect facts, to arrange and interpret them, and to draw inferences
                        from them.** ... **Induction and deduction are both needed** for scientific
                        thought as the left and right foot are both needed for walking.

                        > The laws of economics are to be compared with the laws of the tides,
                        rather than with the simple and exact law of gravitation. For the
                        actions of men are so various and uncertain, that the best statement of
                        tendencies, which we can make in a science of human conduct, must needs
                        be inexact and faulty.

                        laws** which relate to branches of conduct in which the strength economic
                        of the motives chiefly concerned can be measured by a money price.

                        are bound, before entering on any study, to consider carefully what are
                        its uses, we should not plan out our work with direct reference
                        to them.

                        > Economics is thus taken to mean a study of the economic dominant aspects
                        and conditions of man's political, social and private life; but more
                        especially of his social life. The aims of the study are to gain
                        knowledge for its onw sake, and to obtain guidance in the practical
                        conduct of life, and especially of social life. The need for such
                        guidance was never so urgent as now;

                        #### Demand Elasticity

                        Principle of Economics - The elasticity of wants - Book III- Chapter IV and Mathematical Appendix

                        > We have seen that the only universal law as to a person's desire for a
                        commodity is that it diminishes, other things being equal, with every
                        increase in his supply of that commodity. But this diminution may be
                        slow or rapid. If it is slow the price that he will give for the
                        commodity will not fall much in consequence of a considerable increase
                        in his supply of it; and a small fall in price will cause a
                        comparatively large increase in his purchases. But this diminution may
                        be slow or rapid. If it is slow the price that he will give for the
                        commodity will not fall much in consequence of a considerable increase
                        in his supply of it; and a small fall in price will cause a
                        comparatively large increase in his purchases. But if it is rapid, a
                        small fall in price will cause only a very small increase in his
                        purchases. In the former case his willingness to purchase the thing
                        stretches itself out a great deal under the action of a small induce-
                        ment: the elasticity ofhis wants, we may say, is great. In the latter
                        case the extra inducement given by the fall in price causes hardly any
                        extension of his desire to purchase : the elasticity of his demand is
                        small.

                        > We may now turn to consider how far the price which is actually paid for
                        a thing represents the benefit that arises from its possession...The
                        excess of the price which he would be willing to pay rather than go
                        without the thing, over that which he actually does pay, is the economic
                        measure of this surplus satisfaction. It may be called **consumer's
                        surplus**.

                        $COHA$ ; and therefore this area represents the total price paid for
                        tea...the area $DCA$; and therefore this area represents the total
                        consumers' surplus that is derived from tea when the price is $AH$.

                        #### Human Capital

                        > Having discussed the causes which govern the growth of a numerous and
                        vigorous population, we have next to consider the **training that is
                        required to develop its industrial efficiency**.

                        > Little need be said of general education; though the influence School
                        even of that on industrial efficiency is greater than it appears. It is
                        true that the children of the working classes must very often leave
                        school, when they have but learnt the elements of reading, writing,
                        arithmetic and drawing; and it is sometimes argued that part of the
                        little time spent on these subjects would be better given to practical
                        work. But **the advance made at school is important not so much on its own
                        account, as for the power of future advance which a school education
                        gives**. For a truly liberal general education adapts the mind to use its
                        best faculties in business and to use business itself as a means of
                        increasing culture ; though it does not concern itself with the details
                        of particular trades : that is left for technical education.

                        #### External Effects

                        Principle of Economics - Industrial Organization - Book IV - Chapter IX 

                        > We may divide the economies arising from an increase in the scale of
                        production of any kind of goods, into two classes, firstly, External
                        those dependent on the general development of the industry; and,
                        secondly, those dependent on the resources of the individual houses of
                        business engaged in it, on their organization and the efficiency of
                        their management. We may call the former **external economies**, and the
                        latter **internal economies**. In the present chapter we have been chiefly
                        discussing internal economies; but we now proceed to examine those very
                        important external economies which can often be secured by the
                        concentration of many small businesses of a similar character in
                        particular localities: or, as is commonly said, by the localization of
                        industry.


                        Principle of Economics - Increasing and dinishing returns - Book IV - Chapter XIII 

                        > Meanwhile **an increase in the aggregate scale of production of course
                        increases those economies, which do not directly depend on the size of
                        individual houses of business**. The most important of these result from
                        the growth of correlated branches of industry which mutually assist one
                        another, perhaps being concentrated in the same localities, but anyhow
                        availing themselves of the modern facilities for communication offered
                        by steam transport, by the telegraph and by the printing-press. The
                        economies arising from such sources as this, which are accessible to any
                        branch of production, do not depend exclusively upon its own growth :
                        but yet they are sure to grow rapidly and steadily with that growth; and
                        they are sure to dwindle in some, though not in all respects, if it
                        decays.


                       
                        > In other words, we say broadly that while **the part which nature plays in
                        production shows a tendency to diminishing return, the part which man
                        plays shows a tendency to increasing return**. The law of increasing
                        return may be worded thus : An increase of labour and capital leads
                        generally to improved organization, which increases the efficiency of
                        the work of labour and capital....If the actions of the laws of
                        increasing and diminishing return are balanced we have the law of
                        constant return, and an increased produce is obtained by labour and
                        sacrifice increased just in proportion.

                        > Thus we assume that the forces of demand and supply have free play...In
                        such a market there is a demand price for each amount of the commodity,
                        that is, a price at which each particular amount of the General
                        commodity can find purchasers in a day or week or year...The conditions
                        of normal supply are less definite; and a full study of them must be
                        reserved for later chapters. They will be found to vary in detail with
                        the length of the period of time to which the investigation vary refers;

                        > When demand and supply are in equilibrium, the amount of the commodity
                        which is being produced in a unit of time may be called the
                        equilibrium-amount, and the price at which it is being sold
                        equiltbrum-price. Such an equilibrium is stable;

                        > ...some account of the **controversy whether "cost of production" or
                        "utility" governs value** will be given in Appendix I. But it may be well
                        to say a word or two here on this last point. **We might as reasonably
                        dispute whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors
                        that cuts a piece of paper,** as whether value is governed by utility or
                        cost of production. It is true that when one blade is held still, and
                        the cutting is effected by moving the other, we may say with careless
                        brevity that the cutting is done by the second;
                        but the statement is not strictly accurate,and is to be excused only so long as
                        it claims to be merely a popular and not a strictly scientific account
                        of what happens.

                        > The element of time is a chief cause of those difficulties in economic
                        investigations which make it necessary for man with his limited powers
                        to go step by step; breaking up a complex question, studying one bit at
                        a time, and at last combining his partial solutions into a more or less
                        complete solution of the whole riddle. In breaking it up, he segregates
                        those disturbing causes, whose wanderings happen to be inconvenient,
                        for the time in a pound called **Ceteris Paribus**. The study of some group
                        of tendencies is isolated by the assumption other things being equal :
                        the existence of other tendencies is not denied, but their disturbing
                        effect is neglected for a time. The more the issue is thus narrowed, the
                        more exactly can it be handled : but also the less closely does it
                        correspond to real life.

                        his tastes alone, and who possesses one kilogram of bread and one
                        kilogram of wine. Depending on his tastes, he is disposed to have a
                        little less bread and a little more wine, or conversely. He agrees, for
                        example, to have only 0.9 kilograms of bread, provided he can have 1.2
                        kilograms of wine. In other words, this means that for him both these
                        combinations, namely, one kilogram of bread and one kilogram of wine,
                        0.9 kilograms of bread and 1.2 kilograms of wine are equivalent. He does
                        not prefer the second to the first, or the first to the second; he would
                        not know which to choose; **he is indifferent as to whether he enjoys the
                        one or the other of these combinations.**

                        combinations. Starting from the combination of one kilogram of bread and
                        one kilogram of wine, we OA and the quantities of wine along OB. For
                        example, Oa represents one unit of bread, and Ob one unit of wine; the
                        point m, defined by these coordinates, indicates the combination of

                        together the points of this series, we obtain the line $nms$, which may
                        be called the indifference line, or indifference curve. This expression
                        is due to Professor F.Y. Edgeworth. He assumed the existence of
                        utility(ophelimity) and deduced the indifference curves from it; I, on
                        the contrary, consider the indifference curves as a factual datum and
                        infer from them all that is necessary for the theory of equilibrium,
                        without resorting to ophelimity.

                        Manual of Political Economy - Tastes - chapter IV


                        > **Ophelimity, or its index, for one individual, and ophelimity, or its
                        index, for another individual, are heterogeneous quantities. They may
                        neither be added together**, nor compared: No bridge, as the English say. A
                        sum of ophelimities enjoyed by different individuals does not exist;
                        such an expression has no meaning.

                        impossible to move slightly away from this position.[in such a way that the ophelimity enjoyed by each member of the
                        community increases or decreases]. That is to say, every small displacement from
                        this position must necessarily have the e!ect of increasing the ophelimity enjoyed by
                        some individuals and decreasing that enjoyed by others, i.e., of being agreeable to some
                        and disagreeable to others.**

                        > This theorem can be rigorously proved only with the aid of mathematics
                        I shall restrict myself here to providing just a sketch [of the proof]. 
                        Let us start by considering an exchange
                        between two individuals. For the first, the
                        axes are $ox$ and $oy$, and for the second,
                        $\omega\alpha$ and $\omega\beta$‚ and they are positioned in
                        such a way that the paths followed by the
                        two individuals form a single line in [the] Figure.

                        <center><img class="plain" src='assetsHT/Pareto_1.png'  width="250" ></center>

                        > The indifference lines are $t,t',t''$, . . . , for the first individual and
                        $s,s',s''$, . . ., for the second. For the first
                        individual, the hill of pleasure rises from
                        $o$ toward $\omega$, and for the second it rises
                        instead from $\omega$  toward $o$.
                        For phenomena of type (I), we know
                        that the equilibrium point is to be found at
                        a point of tangency of the two individuals’
                        indifference curves. Let $c$ be one of these
                        points. If we move away from it along the
                        path $cc'$, we ascend the hill of pleasure of
                        the first individual and descend that of the second; and conversely if we follow the path
                        $cc''$. It is thus not possible tomove away from $c$ so as to benefit, or harm, both individuals
                        at the same time; but necessarily, if one of them benefits the other is harmed.
